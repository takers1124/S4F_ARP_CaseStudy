# Seeds 4 the Future ARP Case Study, the full script
# parts 3 & 4, prioritize PCUs with...
  # 3 = overlay climate match of PPUs with PCUs
  # 4 = overlay PCUs with nursery inventory

# this script was created by Taylor Akers (ORISE fellow with USFS, RMRS), Fall-Winter 2025

# see ARP_CaseStudy_Overview_RMRS.pdf for a full description of the project

### sum ----
# we want to combine the output of match_clims() function
  # we will do this by summing raster values for all clim match rasters 

# we will see what areas on the landscape would have the greatest overall match for needs areas (PPUs)
  # for this part of the case study, only using PPUs in 8500-9000 ft EB

# set path to folder with all 40 rasters
rast_folder <- getwd() 
# "C:/Users/TaylorAkers/Box/Seeds_for_the_future/R_projects_and_code/S4F_ARP_CaseStudy/output_data/results/test_results/CL_PPUs_8500_9000"

# create a list of raster files in folder 
rast_files <- list.files(path = rast_folder, pattern = "\\.tif$", full.names = TRUE)

# create a spatraster collection
rast_collection <- sds(rast_files)

# sum rast values across all layers
PPU_fut_match_sum_rast <- app(rast_collection, fun = "sum", na.rm = TRUE)
# values range from 1 to 29,
  # so only 29 of the 40 PPUs in this EB have overlapping climate match areas
