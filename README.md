# S4F_ARP_CaseStudy
This repo is designed to share the Seeds 4 the Future (S4F) analysis workflow for our Arapaho-Roosevelt NF (ARP) case study.   
It is a work in progress and I will remove this line when it is completed. 

# Included files

## S4F_ARP_CaseStudy_teaching.R
This file is set up to teach part 1 of the workflow to others. The input_data can be downloaded from a google drive folder (instructions inside script). All input_data are pre-processed to streamline workflow, and the workflow stops after PCUs are created. For the full workflow, see S4F_ARP_CaseStudy_1.R

## S4F_ARP_CaseStudy_1.R
This file is part 1 of the full analysis workflow. All raw data is processed to create PCUs and PPUs for the case study.

## S4F_ARP_CaseStudy_2.R
This file is part 2 of the workflow. It has the climate matching functions used to calculate climate match. 

## S4F_ARP_CaseStudy_3_4.R
This file is parts 3 and 4 of the workflow. Here we find which PCUs overlay with climate-matched areas for PPUs. We also see which PCUs overlay with current nursery inventory.
